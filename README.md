Titanic
=======

This is my approach to tackling the Kaggle project "[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted)".

It contains two main files:
- *titanic.py* - where I tackle the process of developing the best algorithm I can for predicting who survived the Titanic disaster
- *Titanic.ipynb* - an iPython Notebook file, which is meant to be more of a document presenting the coolest finding from my explorations into the data

Feel free to dig into the data. For now, the code is all I have to offer, no cool webpage presenting my findings.

The survivor data files (train.csv, test.csv) come from the Kaggle project, and are therefore subject to their licensing rules.
